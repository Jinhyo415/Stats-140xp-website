In particular, the number of CPU cores, RAM capacity, and CPU frequency have been shown to have a significant impact on pricing. Overall, the analysis provides useful information for cellphone manufacturers to consider technical specifications that are important in pricing.\nThe hypothesis, H0: b1 = b2 = … = bp = 0, Ha: At least one b1 is not 0. This is mainly addressed by the F-test. The F- statistic and its corresponding p-value (&lt; 2.2e-16) strongly reject H0, indicating that at least one predictor contributes significantly to accounting for the variability of the response variable (cell phone price)."

Dataset is numeric value. In this dataset, we want to estimate the price of mobile phones using the above features. I set up the Price of Cellphone as response ”Y”. Other things (weight, ppi, RAM, battery..) are predictors for predicting response Y beacuse technical characteristics were judged to be important for Cellphone price prediction, variables such as resolution, CPU core, and internal memory were selected. I set the hypothesis, H0: b1 = b2 = … = bp = 0, Ha: At least one b1 is not 0. I f H0 reject, we say this result indicated that at least one predictor contributes significantly to accounting for the variability of the response variable (cell phone price).Now we check table of summary about the data.\n\n\n\nFeature\nMin\nX1st.Qu.\nMedian\nMean\nX3rd.Qu.\nMax\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n614.0\n1734.0\n2258.00\n2215.596273\n2744.000\n4361.0\n\n\nweight\n66.0\n134.1\n153.00\n170.426087\n170.000\n753.0\n\n\nresoloution\n1.4\n4.8\n5.15\n5.209938\n5.500\n12.2\n\n\nppi\n121.0\n233.0\n294.00\n335.055901\n428.000\n806.0\n\n\ncpu.core\n0.0\n4.0\n4.00\n4.857143\n8.000\n8.0\n\n\ncpu.freq\n0.0\n1.2\n1.40\n1.502832\n1.875\n2.7\n\n\ninternal.mem\n0.0\n8.0\n16.00\n24.501714\n32.000\n128.0\n\n\nram\n0.0\n1.0\n2.00\n2.204994\n3.000\n6.0\n\n\nRearCam\n0.0\n5.0\n12.00\n10.378261\n16.000\n23.0\n\n\nFront_Cam\n0.0\n0.0\n5.00\n4.503106\n8.000\n20.0\n\n\nbattery\n800.0\n2040.0\n2800.00\n2842.111801\n3240.000\n9500.0\n\n\nthickness\n5.1\n7.6\n8.40\n8.921739\n9.800\n18.5"

F-statistics: 373.3 (p-value &lt; 2.2e-16), indicating that the model as a whole is statistically significant, meaning that the set of independent variables significantly contributes to predicting the dependent variable, price.\n\nIntercept: The base price is about 1874.25.\n\n\nresolution: for every 1 unit increase in resolution, the price decreases by approximately 100.48(p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nppi: for every 1 unit increase in pixel density, the price increases by approximately 1.11(p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\ncpu.core: for every 1 unit increase in CPU cores, the price increases by approximately 63.94 (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\ncpu.freq: For every 1 unit increase in CPU frequency, the price increases by approximately 135.55 (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\ninternal.mem: for every 1 unit increase in internal memory, the price increases by approximately 5.40 (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nram: For every 1 unit increase in RAM, the price increases by approximately 114.68 (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nbattery: for every 1 unit increase in battery capacity, the price increases by approximately 0.11 (p &lt; 0.05).\n\n\nthickness: for every 1 unit increase in thickness, the price decreases by approximately 82.14 (p &lt; 0.05).\nThe model still maintains a high coefficient of determination after excluding the front camera variable and is good at predicting cellphone prices. In particular, the number of CPU cores, RAM capacity, and CPU frequency have been shown to have a significant impact on pricing. Overall, the analysis provides useful information for cellphone manufacturers to consider technical specifications that are important in pricing.\nThe hypothesis, H0: b1 = b2 = … = bp = 0, Ha: At least one b1 is not 0. This is mainly addressed by the F-test. The F- statistic and its corresponding p-value (&lt; 2.2e-16) strongly reject H0, indicating that at least one predictor contributes significantly to accounting for the variability of the response variable (cell phone price)."
